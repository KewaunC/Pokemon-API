How its Made: HTML, CSS, JS, API's

Focus for making this: I wanted to challenge myself for making a Pokemon API where people could enter a number and checkout what pokemon correspondds to each number

What could I have optimized: More data of the pokemon in question. A link to an external website where the user could see more data about the pokemon

Lessons Learned: APIs are alot of fun but I just need to learn that not all APIs are devloper friendly
